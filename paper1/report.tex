\begin{abstract}
Smart Security systems equipped with Video and Audio sensors produce huge amounts unstructured data continuously. 
This paper talks about high level architecture of an intelligent security system with video surveillance,  audio monitoring/recording, video and Audio analytics, alerting homeowners/authorities/agencies as needed.

The key differentiating capability is to use micro drone with voice and video sensors to process the audio and video data with machine learning algorithms. The limited range micro drones can freely move around the house based on the sound and video analytics while learning the friends, family members and strangers.

\section{Introduction}

Having an intelligent ear-and-eye monitoring at the home to constantly observe the surroundings both inside and outside can protect the house and personnel much more safer way. By extending this capability to the neighborhood and city through collaboration would create safe cities across the world. 

\section{Smart Security Systems}

In the todayâ€™s technology world drones are becoming more familiar in the main stream life activities such as recreational, spy cameras by authorities, home delivery of goods etc.
The present security systems used by households are static cameras used at a fixed location inside or outside the house. They are connected to network and provide alerts when any event occurred. However, they are not intelligent enough to understand the context, recognizing the people faces, and aware of family members behaviors, house needs etc.  By making cameras movable across the house and outside and process the data as humans do and take decisions of alerting or informing to the right people is the key concept of this paper.

\subsection{Video Analytics}

We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You can
indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with the command
\texttt{{\char'134}textit}; emboldening with the command
\texttt{{\char'134}textbf} and typewriter-style (for instance, for
computer code) with \texttt{{\char'134}texttt}.  But remember, you do
not have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are part of
the \textit{structural} elements of your article; for instance, the
heading of this subsection will be in a sans serif\footnote{Another
  footnote here.  Let's make this a rather long one to see how it
  looks. Footnotes must be avoided.} typeface, but that is handled by
the document class file.  Take care with the use of the curly braces
in typeface changes; they mark the beginning and end of the text that
is to be in the different typeface.

You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or non-English
characters you need anywhere in your document; you can find a complete
list of what is available in the \textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide}
\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

\subsection{Audio Analytics}

You may want to display math equations in three distinct styles:
inline, numbered or non-numbered display.  Each of
the three are discussed in the next sections.

\subsubsection{Inline (In-text) Equations}

A formula that appears in the running text is called an
inline or in-text formula.  It is produced by the
\textbf{math} environment, which can be
invoked with the usual \texttt{{\char'134}begin\,\ldots{\char'134}end}
construction or with the short form \texttt{\$\,\ldots\$}. You
can use any of the symbols and structures,
from $\alpha$ to $\omega$, available in
\LaTeX~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}; this section will simply show a
few examples of in-text equations in context. Notice how
this equation:

\begin{math}
  \lim_{n\rightarrow \infty}x=0
\end{math},

set here in in-line math style, looks slightly different when
set in display style.  (See next section).

\subsubsection{Display Equations}

A numbered display equation---one set off by vertical space from the
text and centered horizontally---is produced by the \textbf{equation}
environment. An unnumbered display equation is produced by the
\textbf{displaymath} environment.

Again, in either environment, you can use any of the symbols
and structures available in \LaTeX\@; this section will just
give a couple of examples of display equations in context.
First, consider the equation, shown as an inline equation above:

\subsection{Citations}

Citations to articles~\cite{bowman:reasoning, clark:pct, braams:babel,
  herlihy:methodology}, conference proceedings~\cite{clark:pct} or
maybe books \cite{Lamport:LaTeX, salas:calculus} listed in the
Bibliography section of your article will occur throughout the text of
your article.  You should use BibTeX to automatically produce this
bibliography; you simply need to insert one of several citation
commands with a key of the item cited in the proper location in the
\texttt{.tex} file~\cite{Lamport:LaTeX}.  The key is a short reference
you invent to uniquely identify each work; in this sample document,
the key is the first author's surname and a word from the title.  This
identifying key is included with each item in the \texttt{.bib} file
for your article.

The details of the construction of the \texttt{.bib} file are beyond
the scope of this sample document, but more information can be found
in the \textit{Author's Guide}, and exhaustive details in the
\textit{\LaTeX\ User's Guide} by Lamport~\shortcite{Lamport:LaTeX}.

This article shows only the plainest form of the citation command,
using \texttt{{\char'134}cite}.

Some examples.  A paginated journal article \cite{Abril07}, an
enumerated journal article \cite{Cohen07}, a reference to an entire
issue \cite{JCohen96}, a monograph (whole book) \cite{Kosiur01}, a
monograph/whole book in a series (see 2a in spec. document)
\cite{Harel79}, a divisible-book such as an anthology or compilation
\cite{Editor00} followed by the same example, however we only output
the series if the volume number is given \cite{Editor00a} (so
Editor00a's series should NOT be present since it has no vol. no.), a
chapter in a divisible book \cite{Spector90}, a chapter in a divisible
book in a series \cite{Douglass98}, a multi-volume work as book
\cite{Knuth97}, an article in a proceedings (of a conference,
symposium, workshop for example) (paginated proceedings article)
\cite{Andler79}, a proceedings article with all possible elements
\cite{Smith10}, an example of an enumerated proceedings article
\cite{VanGundy07}, an informally published work \cite{Harel78}, a
doctoral dissertation \cite{Clarkson85}, a master's thesis:
\cite{anisi03}, an online document / world wide web resource
\cite{Thornburg01, Ablamowicz07, Poker06}, a video game (Case 1)
\cite{Obama08} and (Case 2) \cite{Novak03} and \cite{Lee05} and (Case
3) a patent \cite{JoeScientist001}, work accepted for publication
\cite{rous08}, 'YYYYb'-test for prolific author \cite{SaeediMEJ10} and
\cite{SaeediJETC10}. Other cites might contain 'duplicate' DOI and
URLs (some SIAM articles) \cite{Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}.
Boris / Barbara Beeton: multi-volume works as books \cite{MR781536}
and \cite{MR781537}.

A couple of citations with DOIs: \cite{2004:ITE:1009386.1010128,
  Kirschmer:2010:AEI:1958016.1958018}.

Online citations: \cite{TUGInstmem, Thornburg01, CTANacmart}.  

We use jabref to manage all citations. A paper without managing a bib
file will be returned without review. in the bibtex file all urls are
added to rfernces with the {\it url} filed. They are not to be
included in the {\it howpublished} or {\it note} field. 

\section{Conclusions}

This paragraph will end the body of this sample document.  Remember
that you might still have Acknowledgments or Appendices; brief samples
of these follow.  There is still the Bibliography to deal with; and we
will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception of the
reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in this paper are to
articles which have nothing to do with the present subject and are
used as examples only.
