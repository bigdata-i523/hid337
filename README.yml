        Smart Security systems equipped with Video and Audio sensors produce
        huge amounts of unstructured data continuously. This paper talks
        about highlevel architecture of an intelligent security system with
        video surveillance, audio monitoring/recording, video and
        Audio analytics, alerting homeowners/authorities/agencies as needed.

        Automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing
        (NLP) based intelligent system can be  used in several human machine
        interface applications both in consumer and industrial sector.
        This paper describes the architecture, building blocks, performance
        and applications for such system that would use pre-developed ASR
        and NLP APIs.

      Not monitoring and gaining insight in to the industrial equipment
      in-service operational behavior has been the biggest bottleneck
      so far, which can be mitigated by using the latest IoT
      technologies. The idea is to collect the critical operational
      parameter data such as vibration, temperature, and load current
      from industrial equipment (compressors, vacuum generators,
      pumps, valves and any other rotating equipment applications etc)
      and perform failure prediction analysis using machine learning
      classification algorithms.
