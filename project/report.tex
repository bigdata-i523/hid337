\section{Introduction}

Put here an introduction about your topic. 
We just need one sample refernce so the paper compiles in LaTeX so we
put it here \cite{editor00}.

\section{figures}

In Figure \ref{f:fly} we show a fly. Please note that because we use
just columwidth that the size of the figure will change to the
columnwidth of the paper once we change the layout to final. CHnaging
the layout to final should not be done by you. All figures will be
listed at the end.

\begin{figure}[!ht]
  \centering\includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{images/fly.pdf}
  \caption{Example caption}\label{f:fly}
\end{figure}

When copying the example, please do not check in the images from the
examples into your images directory as you will not need them for your
paper. Instead use images that you like to include. If you do not have
any images, do not dreate the images folder.

\section{Tables}

In case you need to create tables, you can do this with online tools
(if you do not mind sharing your data) such as
\url{https://www.tablesgenerator.com/} or other such tools (please
google for them). They even allow you to manage tables as CSV.

or generate them by hand while using the provided template in Table\ref{t:mytable}. Not ethat
the caption is before the tabular environment.

\begin{table}[htb]
\centering
\caption{My caption}
\label{t:mytabble}
\begin{tabular}{lll}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
\hline
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\section{Long example}

If you like to see a more elaborate example, please look at
report-long.tex. 

\section{Conclusion}

Put here an conclusion. Conlcusions and abstracts must not have any
citations in the section.

\appendix

We include an appendix with common issues that we see when students
submit papers. One particular important issue is not to use the
underscore in bibtex labels. Sharelatex allows this, but the
proceedings script we have does not allow this.

When you submit the paper you need to address each of the items in the
issues.tex file and verify that you have done them. Please do this
only at the end once you have finished writing the paper. To d this
cange TODO with DONE. However if you check something on with DONE, but
we find you actually have not executed it correcty, you will receive
point deductions. Thus it is important to do this correctly and not
just 5 minutes before the deadline. It is better to do a late
submission than doing the check in haste.
