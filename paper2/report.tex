\appendix

We include an appendix with common issues that we see when students
submit papers. One particular important issue is not to use the
underscore in bibtex labels. Sharelatex allows this, but the
proceedings script we have does not allow this.

When you submit the paper you need to address each of the items in the
issues.tex file and verify that you have done them. Please do this
only at the end once you have finished writing the paper. To d this
cange TODO with DONE. However if you check something on with DONE, but
we find you actually have not executed it correcty, you will receive
point deductions. Thus it is important to do this correctly and not
just 5 minutes before the deadline. It is better to do a late
submission than doing the check in haste.
