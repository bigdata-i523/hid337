\begin{abstract}
Extracting meaningful information from large volumes of unstructured human language is a challenging big data problem. Automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) based intelligent system can be  used in several human machine interface applications both in consumer and industrial sector. Here describing the architecture, building blocks, performance and applications for such system that would use pre-developed ASR and NLP APIs.

\section{Introduction}
As voice becoming a common user interface, the need for accurate and intelligent speech recognition technologies is growing. In speech processing technology there are two main subtasks 
   \begin{itemize}
     \item Speaker Recognition
     \item Speech Recognition
   \end{itemize}
Although the performance of current speaker and speech  recognition systems is far from perfect, these  systems  have already proven their usefulness for certain applications. 
\section{SPEAKER RECOGNITION}
Speaker identification is one of the important task in speech processing. Each person has a voice that is different from everyone else’s.Speaker recognition is the process of identifying who is speaking by using acoustic features of speech.Speaker recognition has been applied mostly in security applications to control access. Current speaker recognition systems are not very accurate for large speaker populations. 

\section{NLP FOR SPEECH RECOGNITION}
Speech recognition is the ability to identify spoken words. It is the process of converting speech into text. This process prepares the input data (speech) to be appropriate for Natural Language Processing(NLP). NLP is the processing of the text to understand the meaning of the text. It comes as the next step of speech recognition. 

Analyzing language for its meaning is a complex task. Modern speech recognition research began in the late 1950s with the advent of the digital computer. The 1960s saw advances in the automatic segmentation of speech into units of linguistic relevance like phonemes, syllables. And now with advancements in the field of Artificial Intelligence, neural networks have been used in many aspects of speech recognition such as phoneme classification,isolated word recognition,audiovisual speech recognition, audiovisual speaker recognition and speaker adaptation. In the context of Speech Recognition, NLP involves 4 basic steps
  \begin{itemize}
     \item Morphological Analysis
     \item Syntactic Analysis
     \item Semantic Analysis
     \item Pragmatic Analysis
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{Morphological Analysis}
Morphological analysis is the identification, analysis, and description of the structure of a given language’s root words, word boundaries, affixes, parts of speech, etc. There are two typical problems in this area, which includes word segmentation and part-of-speech (POS) tagging. Word segmentation is the problem of finding word boundaries in a corpus. 
\subsection{Syntactic Analysis}
Syntactic analysis or parsing is the process of analyzing a string of symbols, either in natural language or in computer languages, conforming to the rules of a formal grammar.
\subsection{Semantic Analysis}
Semantic analysis is the process of relating syntactic structures, from the levels of phrases, clauses, sentences and paragraphs to the level of the writing as a whole, to their language-independent meanings.
\subsection{Pragmatic Analysis}
Pragmatic Analysis is how sentences are used in different situations and how use affects the interpretation of the sentence. Means what was said is reinterpreted as what it actually means.
